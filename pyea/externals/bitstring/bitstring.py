This package defines classes that simplify bit-wise creation, manipulation and
interpretation of data.

Classes:

Bits -- An immutable container for binary data.
BitArray -- A mutable container for binary data.
ConstBitStream -- An immutable container with streaming methods.
BitStream -- A mutable container with streaming methods.

                      Bits (base class)
                     /    \
 + mutating methods /      \ + streaming methods
                   /        \
              BitArray   ConstBitStream
                   \        /
                    \      /
                     \    /
                    BitStream

Functions:

pack -- Create a BitStream from a format string.

Exceptions:

Error -- Module exception base class.
CreationError -- Error during creation.
InterpretError -- Inappropriate interpretation of binary data.
ByteAlignError -- Whole byte position or length needed.
ReadError -- Reading or peeking past the end of a bitstring.
